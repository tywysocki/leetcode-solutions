A Swift-based tool used to interact with the OpenAI HTTP APIs.

## Installation

To integrate the library, Swift Package Manager is your tool of choice. Add the following dependency to the Package.swift file:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/tywysocki/OpenAI.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Usage

Import the library:

```swift
import OpenAI
```
Create an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and add it to your configuration.

```swift
let openAI = OpenAI(authToken:"API_KEY")
```

With this library, you can take advantage of Swift concurrency. The code snippets provided below demonstrate both async/await and completion handler implementations.

### [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)

Use the `openAI.sendCompletion` method to send a request to the completions endpoint of the API. All you need to do is provide the desired text prompt as input, and the model will generate a text completion that is intended to match the context or pattern you provided. Keep in mind that the model's success generally depends on the complexity of the task and [quality of your prompt](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design).

#### Completion handler:

```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "How are you doing today") { result in // Result<OpenAIModel, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.choices.first?.text ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

**async/await:**

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendCompletion(
        with: "What is today's date?",
        model: .gpt3(.davinci), // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        maxTokens: 16,          // optional `Int?`
        temperature: 1          // optional `Double?`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

For a list of supported models, refer to [OpenAIModelType.swift](https://github.com/tywysocki/OpenAI/blob/master/Sources/OpenAI/Models/OpenAIModelType.swift). For detailed information about these models, refer to the [OpenAI API Docs]().

### [Chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

Access ChatGPT (aka GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 (beta) using the `openAI.sendChat` method. The chat models require a series of messages as input, and produce a model-generated message as output. Each element in the `chat` array is a `ChatMessage` object, containing a `role` (either "system", "user", or "assistant") and `content` (the message content). Typically, conversations begin with a system message (which establishes the behavior of the assistant) followed by alternating user and assistant messages.

**Example API call:**

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [
        ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who played in the 30th Super Bowl?"),
        ChatMessage(role: .assistant, content: "The 30th Super Bowl was played between the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers."),
        ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who won the game?")
    ]
                
    let result = try await openAI.sendChat(with: chat)
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

This library supports all API parameters, except for streaming message content that has not been completed yet.

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [...]

    let result = try await openAI.sendChat(
        with: chat,
        model: .chat(.chatgpt),         // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        user: nil,                      // optional `String?`
        temperature: 1,                 // optional `Double?`
        topProbabilityMass: 1,          // optional `Double?`
        choices: 1,                     // optional `Int?`
        stop: nil,                      // optional `[String]?`
        maxTokens: nil,                 // optional `Int?`
        presencePenalty: nil,           // optional `Double?`
        frequencyPenalty: nil,          // optional `Double?`
        logitBias: nil                  // optional `[Int: Double]?`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create)

To generate an original image based on a text prompt, use the `openAI.sendImages` method. For better results, provide a detailed text prompt.

```swift
openAI.sendImages(with: "Hand drawn sketch of a Porsche 911.", numImages: 1, size: .size1024) { result in // Result<OpenAIModel, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.data.first?.url ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

### [Edits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits)

To edit text based on a prompt and a modification instruction, use `openAI.sendEdits`. The method takes a prompt and a modification instruction as input and returns an edited version of the prompt as output.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendEdits(
        with: "Fix the spelling mistake.",
        model: .feature(.davinci),               // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        input: "Me name is Ty"
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)

To obtain a vector representation of a text string, make a request to the embeddings endpoint with `openAI.sendEmbeddings`. The method returns a vector representation of the text string that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms. For more information and use cases, refer to the [API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendEmbeddings(
        with: "The service was great and the clerk..."
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations)

The moderation endpoint is a tool you can use to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies. To obtain a classification for a piece of text, send a request to the moderation endpoint with the `openAI.sendModeration` method.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendModeration(
        with: "Unmoderated text",
        model: .moderation(.latest)     // optional `OpenAIModelType`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```
