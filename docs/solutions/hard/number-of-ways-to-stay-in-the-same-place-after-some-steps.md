## Description

!!! question "LeetCode Problem 1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps"

    You have a pointer at index `0` in an array of size `arrLen`. At each step, you can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array, or stay in the same place (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any time).

    Given two integers `steps` and `arrLen`, return the number of ways such that your pointer is still at index `0` after exactly `steps` steps. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10`^9^` + 7`.
