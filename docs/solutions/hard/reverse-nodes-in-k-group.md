## Description

!!! question "LeetCode Problem 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group"

    Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

    `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

    You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
