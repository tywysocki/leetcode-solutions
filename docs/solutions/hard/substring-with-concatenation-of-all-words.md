## Description

!!! question "LeetCode Problem 30. Substring With Concatenation of All Words"

    You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

    A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

    For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
